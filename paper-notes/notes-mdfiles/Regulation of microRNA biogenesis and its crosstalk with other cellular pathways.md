# Name
Paper Notes of [Regulation of microRNA biogenesis and its crosstalk with other cellular pathways](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-018-0059-1.)

# Abstract
#### Notes
* [Drosha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosha): Members of the ribonuclease III superfamily of double-stranded (ds) RNA-specific endoribonucleases participate in diverse RNA maturation and decay pathways in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The RNase III Drosha is `the core nuclease` that executes the `initiation step of microRNA (miRNA) processing` in the nucleus.
* [Dicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicer): Dicer, also known as endoribonuclease Dicer or helicase with RNase motif, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the *DICER1* gene. Being part of the RNase III family, Dicer `cleaves` double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and `pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA)` into short single-stranded RNA fragments called small interfering RNA and `microRNA`, respectively.

|**RISC**| RNA-induced-silencing complex|
|**AGO**| Argonaute (protein family) |

#### Arranged conclusion
* miRNAs: short ncRNAs ==> inhibit the expression of target gene
* pri-miRNA ==> Drosha and Dicer ==> mature miRNA
* `RISC-loading`: process of RISC formation; mature miRNA bound by AGO protein family
* transcription of miRNAs, Drosha & Dicer processing, RISC-loading are key steps in miRNA biogenesis
* regulatory factors ==> coordinate individual miRNA processing & connect miRNA biogenesis with other cellular processes
* non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways have been characterized

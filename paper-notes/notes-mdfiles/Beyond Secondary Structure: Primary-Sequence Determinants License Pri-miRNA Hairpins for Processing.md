Paper Notes of [Beyond Secondary Structure: Primary-Sequence Determinants License Pri-miRNA Hairpins for Processing](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867413000834)

# Abstract
#### Notes
* [Caenorhabditis elegans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans): Caenorhabditis elegans is a free-living, transparent nematode, about 1 mm in length, that lives in temperate soil environments. It is the type species of its genus.
* > we generated many variants of ...., and compared them with the starting variants ==> method
* Terms

| Abbreviation | Whole name|
| :---: | :---: |
|**CNNC**| SRp20-binding motif|

#### Arranged conclusion
* pri-miRNAs form important hairpins structure for the biogenesis procedure, but `determinats` are needed to distinguish it from the other hairpin-containing transcripts
* Using `Caenorhabditis elegans` to generate variants ==> sequencing data ==> data analysis and comparison ==> results ==> experiments verification
* results:
    - importance of pairing in the stem 
    - three primary-sequence determinants, including `CNNC`

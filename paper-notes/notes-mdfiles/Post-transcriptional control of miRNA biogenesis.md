# Name
Paper Notes of [Post-transcriptional control of miRNA biogenesis](http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1261/rna.)

# Abstract
> Notes
* [Endoribonuclease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoribonuclease): An Endoribonuclease is a `ribonuclease endonuclease`. It cleaves either single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, depending on the enzyme.
* Terms

| Abbreviation | Whole name|
| :---: | :---: |
|**RISC**| RNA-induced-silencing complex|
|**RBPs**| RNA-binding proteins|

> Arranged conclusions
* MicroRNAs ==> important regulators of gene express; bind to mRNAs; repress the expression
* Procedure of precursor miRNA to mature miRNA happens in both nuclear and cytoplasmic environment, with the help of *DROSHA* and *DICER* respectively
* Papers focus on post-transcriptional mechanisms, including both *cis*-acting and *trans*-acting factors
* Highlight the role of **RBPs** in the RNA pathway

# Introduction -- miRNA Biogenesis Pathway
> Notes
* Many miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II(Pol II), and the sources of the genes could be divided into three parts:
  * intronic clusters of within protein-coding pre-mRNAs ==> most parts
  * independent gene units
  * been encoded within long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
* Canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway includes two subsequent processing events, happened in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm respectively, and with the help of RNase III `Drosha` and `Dicer` respectively.
* Noncanonical miRNA biogenesis pathways may lead to the production of functional miRNAs, and may include following pathways:
  * `mitrons` generated via pre-mRNA splicing
  * miRNAs generated from `small nucleolar RNA`([snoRNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_nucleolar_RNA)) precursors
* Terms

| Abbreviation | Whole name|

|pri-miRNA| long primary transcript to form the microRNA|
| pre-miRNA | ~ 70 nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNAs|
|**DGCR8**| DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 gene|
|**RISC**| RNA-induced-silencing complex|
| **AGO** | Argonaute protein|

> Arranged conclusion
* Detailed procedure of the canonical biogenesis of miRNAs
  * The *nuclear event* is catalyzed by the `Microprocessor complex`, and the result production is the ~ 79 nt stem-loop `pre-miRNAs`. The `Microprocessor complex` consists of the following:
    * RNase III `DROSHA`
    * ds RBP `DGCR8`
    * associated proteins
  * The `pre-miRNAs` are exported to the cytoplasm using the export receptor, `Exportin-5`.
  * The *cytoplasm event* is catalyzed by the RNase III `DICER` to give rise to `miRNA duplexes`. ==> incorporated into the `RISC` with `AGO` ==> one strand is chosed to become the mature miRNA.

## Nuclear step of miRNA processing
> Notes
* The nuclear phase of miRNA processing happens cotranscriptionally acting on both independently transcribed and intron-encoded miRNA. And the process is facilitated by `HP1BP3`, a histone H1-like chromatin protein.
* Determinants to distinguish the pri-miRNA from other hairpin-containing transcripts:
  * one ~35 bp stem harboring a mismatched GHG motif and three primary-sequence elements as following
  * a basal UG motif
  * an apical UGUG motif
  * a CNNC motif, which could bind to the SR protein ==> SRSF3
  * the presence of an N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) mark in the vincity of the pri-miRNA stem-loop( this mark is bound by the reader ==> the hnRNP protein, A2/B1 ==> interacts with DGCR8 to stimulate the processing)
* The precise mechanism by which the `Microprocessor` recognizes the pri-miRNA and catalyzes their processing:
  * The structure of `Microprocessor`: heterotrimeric complex comprising one `DROSHA` and two `DGCR8` molecules
  * The function of `DGCR8` dimer: interact with the

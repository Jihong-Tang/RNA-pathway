# Name
Paper Notes of [Post-transcriptional control of miRNA biogenesis](http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1261/rna.)

# Abstract
#### Notes
* [Endoribonuclease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoribonuclease): An Endoribonuclease is a `ribonuclease endonuclease`. It cleaves either single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, depending on the enzyme.
* Terms

| Abbreviation | Whole name|
| :---: | :---: |
|**RISC**| RNA-induced-silencing complex|
|**RBPs**| RNA-binding proteins|

#### Arranged conclusion
* MicroRNAs ==> important regulators of gene express; bind to mRNAs; repress the expression
* Procedure of precursor miRNA to mature miRNA happens in both nuclear and cytoplasmic environment, with the help of *DROSHA* and *DICER* respectively
* Papers focus on post-transcriptional mechanisms, including both *cis*-acting and *trans*-acting factors
* Highlight the role of **RBPs** in the RNA pathway

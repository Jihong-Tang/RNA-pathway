# [Introduction](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/) 

Broadly speaking, a compute cluster is a collection of networked computers which we call nodes. Our clusters are only accessible to researchers remotely; your gateway to the cluster is the **login node**. From this node, you will be able to view your files and dispatch jobs to one or several other nodes across the cluster configured for computation, called **compute nodes**. The tool we use to submit these jobs is called a **job scheduler**. All compute nodes on a cluster mount a **shared filesystem**; a file server or set of servers that keeps track of all files on a large array of disks, so that you can access and edit your data from any compute node.

`tmux` is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal.
